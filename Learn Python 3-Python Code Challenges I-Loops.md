**Python Code Challenges I - Loops**

1. Divisible By Ten

    Letâ€™s start our code challenges with a function that counts how many numbers are divisible by ten from a list of numbers. This function will accept a list of numbers as an input parameter and use a loop to check each of the numbers in the list. Every time a number is divisible by 10, a counter will be incremented and the final count will be returned. These are the steps we need to complete this:

        a.  Define the function to accept one input parameter called nums

        b.  Initialize a counter to 0

        c.  Loop through every number in nums

        d.  Within the loop, if any of the numbers are divisible by 10, increment our counter

        e.  Return the final counter value

    1.  Create a function named divisible_by_ten() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.

    2.  Return the count of how many numbers in the list are divisible by 10.

    >   Code :

        #Write your function here

        def divisible_by_ten(nums):

            count = 0

            for number in nums:

                if (number % 10 == 0):

                    count += 1

            return count

        #Uncomment the line below when your function is done

        print(divisible_by_ten([20, 25, 30, 35, 40]))

    >   Result  :

2. Greetings

    You are invited to a social gathering, but you are tired of greeting everyone there. Luckily we can create a function to accomplish this task for us. In this challenge, we will take a list of names and prepend the string 'Hello, ' before each name. This will require a few steps:

        a.  Define the function to accept a list of strings as a single parameter called names

        b.  Create a new list of strings

        c.  Loop through each name in names

        d.  Within the loop, concatenate 'Hello, ' and the current name together and append this new string to the new list of strings

        e.  Afterwards, return the new list of strings
