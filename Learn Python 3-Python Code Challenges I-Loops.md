**Python Code Challenges I - Loops**

1. Divisible By Ten

    Letâ€™s start our code challenges with a function that counts how many numbers are divisible by ten from a list of numbers. This function will accept a list of numbers as an input parameter and use a loop to check each of the numbers in the list. Every time a number is divisible by 10, a counter will be incremented and the final count will be returned. These are the steps we need to complete this:

        a.  Define the function to accept one input parameter called nums

        b.  Initialize a counter to 0

        c.  Loop through every number in nums

        d.  Within the loop, if any of the numbers are divisible by 10, increment our counter

        e.  Return the final counter value
