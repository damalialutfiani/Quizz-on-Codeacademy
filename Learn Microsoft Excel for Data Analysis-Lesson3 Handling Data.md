Lesson 3 - **Handling Data**

1.  Why should you import a CSV instead of simply opening it in Excel?

    a.  It is actually better to open the CSV directly.
    
    b.  **Importing a CSV makes sure that all of Excel's features will work and allows you to properly specify data types during the import process.**
    
    c.  Importing a CSV automatically inspects and validates the data.

2.  Column A has a list of weekday names. You’d like to abbreviate them to just the first two letters. What formula would you use?

        = _____ ( _____ , _____ )
        
    a.  "two"
    
    b.  RIGHT()
    
    c.  **LEFT**
    
    d.	**A1**
    
    e.  3
    
    f.  **2**
    
    g.  TRIM()

    Click or drag and drop to fill in the blank
    
        =LEFT(A1, 2)

3.  You’ve been given a dataset measuring miles-per-gallon for various different vehicle models. The dataset has several thousand rows. You want to inspect the numbers for validity. What would you do first?

    a.  Use a heatmap to color in large or small values.
    
    b.  **Sort the data from least to most efficient and look for excessively large or small values.**
    
    c.  Scroll through the table looking for very large or small values.
