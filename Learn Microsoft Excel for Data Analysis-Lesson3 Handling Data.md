Lesson 3 - **Handling Data**

1.  Why should you import a CSV instead of simply opening it in Excel?

    a.  It is actually better to open the CSV directly.
    
    b.  **Importing a CSV makes sure that all of Excel's features will work and allows you to properly specify data types during the import process.**
    
    c.  Importing a CSV automatically inspects and validates the data.

2.  Column A has a list of weekday names. Youâ€™d like to abbreviate them to just the first two letters. What formula would you use?

= _____ ( _____ , _____ )
-	"two"
-	RIGHT()
-	**LEFT**
-	**A1**
-	3
-	**2**
-	TRIM()
Click or drag and drop to fill in the blank
=LEFT(A1, 2)
