Lesson 3 - **Handling Data**

1.  Why should you import a CSV instead of simply opening it in Excel?

    a.  It is actually better to open the CSV directly.
    
    b.  **Importing a CSV makes sure that all of Excel's features will work and allows you to properly specify data types during the import process.**
    
    c.  Importing a CSV automatically inspects and validates the data.
