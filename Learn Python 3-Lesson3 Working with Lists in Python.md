Lesson 3 – **Working with Lists in Python**
1.	Which of the following commands will return the length of the list mylist?
-	**len(mylist)**
-	length(mylist)
-	mylist.len()
-	mylist.length()
2.	Which of the following lines of code would slice the list [“b”, “c”] from mylist:
Mylist = [“a”, “b”, “c”, “d”, “e”]
-	mylist[1,3]
-	mylist[1:2]
-	mylist[1,2]
-	**mylist[1:3]**
3.	Complete the code to insert “Buffalo” into a list called animals as the 4th element?

-	**“Buffalo”**
-	**3**
-	**animals**
