Lesson 3 – **Working with Lists in Python**
1.	Which of the following commands will return the length of the list mylist?

    a.  **len(mylist)**
  
    b.  length(mylist)
  
    c.  mylist.len()
  
    d.  mylist.length()
  
2.	Which of the following lines of code would slice the list [“b”, “c”] from mylist:

        mylist = [“a”, “b”, “c”, “d”, “e”]
    
    a.  mylist[1,3]
    
    b.  mylist[1:2]
    
    c.  mylist[1,2]
    
    d.  **mylist[1:3]**
    
3.	Complete the code to insert “Buffalo” into a list called animals as the 4th element?

        ___ . ___ ( ___ , ___ )

    a.  **“Buffalo”**
    
    b.  **3**
    
    c.  **animals**
    
    d.  2
    
    e.  4
    
    f.  **insert**
    
    g.  append
    
    Click or drag and drop to fill in the blank
    
    So, the answer is **animals.insert( 3 , “Buffalo” )**
    
4.	Which of the following lines of code would remove “Breakdancing” from the list olympic_sports.

        olympic_sports = [“Hockey”, “Swimming”, “Fencing”, “Volleyball”, “Breakdancing”]

    a.  olympic_sports.pop[“Breakdancing”]
    
    b.  olympic_sports.pop(-2)
    
    c.  **olympic_sports.pop()**
    
    d.  olympic_sports.pop(3)
    
5.	Which of the following lines of code will tell us how many times “win” appears in the list game_results?

    a.  **game_results.count(“win”)**
    
    b.  “win”.count(game_results)
    
    c.  count(game_results, “win”)

6.	Which of the following would be generated by the code snippet?

        mylist = [“a”, “b”, “c”, “d”, “e”, “f”]
    
        print(my_list[2:5])
        
    a.  [“b”, “c”, “d”, “e”]
    
    b.  [“b”, “c”, “d”]
    
    c.  **[“c”, “d”, “e”]**
    
    d.  [“c”, “d”, “e”, “f”]

7.	Which of the following lines of code will correctly sort mylist?
-	**mylist.sort()**
-	sort(mylist)
-	mylist.sorted()
-	mylist.sort

8.	Which list would be created by running this code?
list(range(2, 14, 4))
-	[4, 8, 10, 12, 14]
-	**[2, 6, 10]**
-	[2, 6, 10, 14]
-	[2, 6, 10, 12]

9.	Which of the following would create a range object that starts at 3 and goes up to 15 (non-inclusive) in increments of 4?
-	**range(3, 15, 4)**
-	range(4, 15, 3)
-	range(3, 4, 15)
-	range(15, 4, 3)

10.	Fill in the code that would allow us to remove the 5th element from the following list :
pizza_toppings = [“Cheese”, “Pepperoni”, “Garlic”, “Pineapple”, “Mushroom”, “Prosciutto”]
___ . ___ ( ___ )
-	5
-	**pop**
-	**pizza_toppings**
-	3
-	**4**
Click or drag and drop to fill in the blank
So, the answer is **pizza_toppings.pop(4)**

11.	Which of the following lines of code will insert “Gus” as the middle element of the list friends?
friends = [“Annabelle”, “Greg”, “Katya”, “Sol”]
-	friends.insert(-3, “Gus”)
-	insert(friends, 2, “Gus”)
-	friends.insert(1, “Gus”)
-	**friends.insert(-2, “Gus”)**

12.	Which of the following code selects the las three elements of mylist?
-	mylist[:-3]
-	**mylist[-3:]**
-	mylist[3:]
-	mylist[-3, -2, -1]
