Lesson 2 – Control Flow
1.	Consider the code below; what would this prin to the terminal?

x=5

if x <= 2 :
	print(“This is printed.”)
if x <= 4 :
	print(“This is also printed.”)
if x <= 6 :
	print(“Is this printed?”)
if x <= 8 :
	print(“This might be printed.”)
-	Is this printed?
-	**Is this printed?**
**This might be printed.**
-	This is printed.
This is also printed.
-	Nothing is printed.
	
2.	Determine the truth value of the following expression:
3	** 2 + 1 != 30 / 3
-	True
-	**False**
3.	Determine the truth value of the following expression :
(9 – 4) * 2 == 77 / 7 -1
-	False
-	**True**
4.	Determine the truth value of the following expression :
4 * 5 <= 21 - 1
-	False
-	**True**
5.	Determine the truth value of the following expression:
(4	<= 2 * 3) and (7 + 1 == 8)
-	**True**
-	False
6.	Read the following code carefully. What will happen when the code is executed?
x = 0

if x = 0:
	print(“x is equal to zero.”)
if x >= 0:
	print(“x is greater than zero.”)
else:
	print(“x is less than zero.”)

-	**There will be a SyntaxError.**
-	“x is equal to zero.” and “x is greater than zero.” will print to the terminal.
-	“x is greater than zero.” will print to the terminal.
-	“x is equal to zero.” will print to the terminal
7.	Which of the following variables contains a Boolean value?
- my_chill_variable = “This is True.”
- **my_cool_variable = 7 +8 != 13**
- my_super_variable = “True” + “False”
- my_fun_variable = 2 + 9
8.  Which of the following is a Boolean expression?
- Three is the most elegant number.
- The New York Yankees are the classiest baseball team.
- **My name is Angelo.**
- This quiz is very hard.
