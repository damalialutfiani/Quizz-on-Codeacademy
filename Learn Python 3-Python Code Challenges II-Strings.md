**Python Code Challenges II - Strings**

1.  Count Letters

    For the first code challenge, we are going to count the number of unique letters in a string. This means that when we are looking at the word, any new letters should be counted and any duplicates should not be counted. There are a few ways to solve this, but we can use the provided alphabet string to ensure that duplicates are not counted. Here is what we need to do:

        a.  Define the function to accept one parameter — the word whose letters we are counting
        b.  Create a counter to keep track of unique letters
        c.  Loop through every letter in our alphabet string. If the current letter was found in our word, increase our count
        d.  Return the count after looping through all letters.

    1.  Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter. The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.

    2.  We’ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet. It will be helpful to include that list in your function.
