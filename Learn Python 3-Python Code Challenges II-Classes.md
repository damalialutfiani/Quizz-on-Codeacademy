**Python Code Challenges II - Classes**

1.  Setting Up Our Robot
    Letâ€™s begin by creating the class for our robot. We will begin by setting up the instance variables to keep track of important data related to the robot. Here are the steps we need to do:

        a.  Create a new class called DriveBot
        b.  Set up a basic constructor (no parameters needed)
        c.  Initialize three instance variables within our constructor which all default to 0: motor_speed, direction, and sensor_range

    >   Coding question

        Create a python class called DriveBot. Within this class, create instance variables for motor_speed, sensor_range, and direction. All of these should be initialized to 0 by default. After setting up the class, create an object from the class called robot_1. Set the motor_speed to 5, the direction to 90, and the sensor_range to 10. Use the provided print statements to check your work!
