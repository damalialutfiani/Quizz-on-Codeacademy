1. First Three Multiples

    Letâ€™s start by creating a function which both prints and returns values. For this function, we are going to print out the first three multiples of a number and return the third multiple. This means that we are going to print 1, 2, and 3 times the input number and then return the value of 3 times the input number. For this, we are going to need a few steps:

        a.  Define the function header to accept one input parameter called num

        b.  Print out 1 times num
      
        c.  Print out 2 times num
      
        d.  Print out 3 times num
      
        e.  Return the value of 3 times num
