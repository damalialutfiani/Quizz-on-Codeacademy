**Python Code Challenges I - Functions**

1. Tenth Power

    Letâ€™s create some functions which can help us solve math problems! For this first function, we are going to take the tenth power of a number. In order to do this we need to do three things:

        a.  Set up the function header for tenth_power which accepts one parameter

        b.  Take the tenth power of the input value

        c.  Return the result
