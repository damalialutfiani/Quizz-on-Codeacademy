**Python Code Challenges I - Functions**

1. Tenth Power

    Letâ€™s create some functions which can help us solve math problems! For this first function, we are going to take the tenth power of a number. In order to do this we need to do three things:

        a.  Set up the function header for tenth_power which accepts one parameter

        b.  Take the tenth power of the input value

        c.  Return the result
    
    >   Coding question
    
    1.  Write a function named tenth_power() that has one parameter named num.

    2.  The function should return num raised to the 10th power.
    
    >   Code :

        # Write your tenth_power function here:
        
        def tenth_power(num):

            return num ** 10

        # Uncomment these function calls to test your tenth_power function:

        print(tenth_power(1))

        # 1 to the 10th power is 1

        print(tenth_power(0))

        # 0 to the 10th power is 0

        print(tenth_power(2))

        # 2 to the 10th power is 1024

    >   Result  :

2. Square Root

    Another useful function for solving math problems is the square root function. We can create this using similar steps from the last problem. The code will look very similar. We need to:

        a.  Set up the function header for square_root which accepts one parameter

        b.  Take the square root of the input value

        c.  Return the result
